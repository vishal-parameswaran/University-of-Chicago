       "\"Artificial intelligence improves parking efficiency in Chinese cities - People's Daily OnlineHomeChina PoliticsForeign AffairsOpinionsVideo: We Are ChinaBusinessMilitaryWorldSocietyCultureTravelScienceSportsPhotoLanguagesChineseJapaneseFrenchSpanishRussianArabicKoreanGermanPortugueseThursday, March , Home>>Artificial intelligence improves parking efficiency in Chinese citiesBy LiuShiyao (People's Daily) :16, March , Photo taken on July , , shows a sign for electronic toll collection (ETC) newly set up at a roadside parking space on Yangzhuang road, Shijingshan district, Beijing. Some urban areas of the city started to use ETC system for roadside parking spaces since July , . (Peoples Daily Online/Li Wenming)Thanks to the application of an artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered roadside electronic toll collection (ETC) system, Chinas capital city Beijing has seen significant improvement in the efficiency of parking fee collection, turnover of roadside parking spots, order in roadside parking, as well as traffic congestion.As the city further deepens its roadside parking reform, the ETC system has almost covered all the roadside parking spaces in the city, with the proportion of vehicles parked on roads using the system exceeding percent.With the AI-empowered system, drivers can park their vehicles at the parking spots on the roadside, and then pay the parking charge via their mobile phones after they drive away.This road used to be full of cars, and even the normal lanes were occupied. You could hardly move a bit during the morning and evening commute time, recalled a citizen surnamed Wang, who lives in Chaoyang district of Beijing.Since the summer of , roadside ETC devices have been installed here. With all the cars being parked in designated parking spots on the roadside, the road now seems brighter and wider, Wang said.The smart roadside ETC system AIpark Sky Eye adopted by Beijing is developed, operated, and maintained by AIpark, a Beijing-based leading smart parking solution provider.The companys intelligent system has brought into full play the advantages of AI technologies and effectively addressed the shortage of parking spaces and the problem of irregular parking in cities. The system has therefore been listed among the countrys innovation projects that integrate AI deeply into the real economy in by Chinas Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT).Traditional parking management equipment and monitoring devices have failed to meet the actual needs of cities due to limited application scenarios and technical capacity. There are many deficiencies in traditional parking systems. For example, magnetic devices cannot identify detailed information about vehicles; each video monitoring pile can only cover one parking spot; and manual collection of parking fees costs too much.Such problems dont exist in smart machines. The AIpark Sky Eye system boasts strong stability and high recognition rate. Besides, it can resist the interference of extreme weather conditions like rain, snow, and fog, and form complete graphic evidence based on wheel path of vehicles.Each set of cameras of the AIpark Sky Eye system can monitor multiple parking spots at the same time for hours a day. The data collected by front-end cameras are processed using multi-dimensional deep learning algorithm before they are uploaded on to an AI computing cloud platform for data enrichment. The platform then distributes identification results to transport authorities.The most distinctive innovation in the technological package of the system is precision brought about by high-mounted parking system cameras, according to Xiang Yanping, senior vice president of AIpark, noting that the cameras can recognize more complex static and dynamic reality scenes.For example, the equipment can accurately identify irregular parking behaviors and state such as double parking and frequent maneuvers, precisely recognize detailed information including plate number and vehicle color, and make good judgment on the behaviors of drivers and pedestrians, Xiang said.Once the high-mounted parking system cameras are installed, they can help with many aspects of integrated urban governance, which represents another advantage of the AIpark Sky Eye system.Besides managing parking fee collection, high-mounted camera system can also provide data for traffic improvements. The snapshots obtained from the camera system can help solve problems including illegal and inappropriate parking and vehicle theft.So far, the smart ETC system of AIpark has been introduced into more than cities in China, signaling increasingly important roles of AI in improving parking efficiency and order as well as new development opportunities for smart parking industry.123PhotosNaval fleet steams in East China SeaNewborn golden snub-nosed monkey makes debutIn pics: birds across ChinaGrain painting studio helps villagers to increase incomeRelated StoriesExhibition highlighting art-science integration opens in BeijingChinas AI industry poised to enter boom timesAlibaba outlines technology trends for Chinas leading AI enterprise iFlytek to develop health information technologyCheetah Mobile wades into artificial intelligenceChina overtakes the US in investment in AI5 million artificial intelligence talents urgently needed in ChinaGraduate students give 'voice' to sign languageArtificial Intelligence in real livesMicrosoft embraces artificial intelligenceAbout People's Daily Online | Join Us | Contact UsCopyright People's Daily Online.

AI is used in various functions inside smartphones such as intelligent power optimization, imaging, virtual assistants, and to enhance device performance. The report highlights the fact that AI has become the most important technology in modern smartphones. The push to add on-device AI computational power to enable Edge AI computing is a priority for smartphone and chipset vendors. Strategy Analytics estimates that % of all smartphones sold worldwide in will have on-device AI, says Associate Director Ville-Petteri Ukonaho. Advantages of on-device AI computing include lower latency, better data privacy and overall lower power consumption.An Artificial Intelligence (AI) smartphone is one that uses an AI core / processor designed to run machine learning and deep learning tasks. AI smartphones run AI tasks locally on the device with the help of dedicated AI cores and AI co-processors with little or no data transmitted to the cloud. Examples of AI smartphones include Apples iPhone Pro Max and Samsungs Galaxy S21 Ultra G.Artificial Intelligence has become a key technology in higher-end smartphones, says Ken Hyers, Director at Strategy Analytics. A smartphone equipped with on-device AI can significantly improve important tasks like helping users take better pictures, deliver longer battery life through efficient power management, improve the speed of response by digital assistants, and power Augmented Reality, among other tasks. This makes smartphones more useful tools for users.Modern smartphones give consumers access to their own personal AI powered super-computer, says Ville-Petteri Ukonaho. With the help of on-device Artificial Intelligence, virtual assistants like Siri and Googles Assistant have become more intelligent and aware of their environment. Strategy Analytics new report estimates that in over % of smartphones globally will have virtual assistants and the share will grow to % by .With the enhanced AI capabilities on-device, virtual assistants have become more intelligent and aware of their environment, comments Ken Hyers. Strategy Analytics report finds that Googles Assistant is the top virtual assistant in with over % share followed by Apples Siri.On-device AI is powered by physical silicon cores such as Apples Neural Engine or distributed software frameworks such as Qualcomm Neural Processing Engine (NPE) that use algorithms to offload AI computation to several processors (CPU, GPU and DSP). Physical AI cores have greater capability to handle complex AI computations, thus those are being introduced by all major chip vendors such as Mediatek, Samsung and HiSilicon, says Ville-Petteri Ukonaho.Camera AI has become one of the key selling points of imaging focused smartphones, says Ken Hyers and continues, Artificial Intelligence features such as object recognition or motion detection are becoming growingly important in premium smartphones. In the report Strategy Analytics concludes that over % of smartphones already have AI enhanced camera functionalities.Strategy Analytics finds in its latest report that technologies such as G will greatly benefit from the new capabilities improved by AI and vice versa. With the help of G and AI, smartphones have become integral part of a large device ecosystem enabling them to share data and communicate with each other.The report Smartphones: Global Artificial Intelligence Technologies Forecast to is available to Strategy Analytics clients.About Strategy AnalyticsStrategy Analytics, Inc. is a global leader in supporting companies across their planning lifecycle through a range of customized market research solutions.

       "  'Some urban areas of the city started to use ETC system for roadside parking spaces since July , .',\n",
       "  '(Peoples Daily Online/Li Wenming)Thanks to the application of an artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered roadside electronic toll collection (ETC) system, Chinas capital city Beijing has seen significant improvement in the efficiency of parking fee collection, turnover of roadside parking spots, order in roadside parking, as well as traffic congestion.',\n",
       "  'As the city further deepens its roadside parking reform, the ETC system has almost covered all the roadside parking spaces in the city, with the proportion of vehicles parked on roads using the system exceeding percent.',\n",
       "  'With the AI-empowered system, drivers can park their vehicles at the parking spots on the roadside, and then pay the parking charge via their mobile phones after they drive away.',\n",
       "  'This road used to be full of cars, and even the normal lanes were occupied.',\n",
       "  'You could hardly move a bit during the morning and evening commute time, recalled a citizen surnamed Wang, who lives in Chaoyang district of Beijing.',\n",
       "  'Since the summer of , roadside ETC devices have been installed here.',\n",
       "  'With all the cars being parked in designated parking spots on the roadside, the road now seems brighter and wider, Wang said.',\n",
       "  'The smart roadside ETC system AIpark Sky Eye adopted by Beijing is developed, operated, and maintained by AIpark, a Beijing-based leading smart parking solution provider.',\n",
       "  'The companys intelligent system has brought into full play the advantages of AI technologies and effectively addressed the shortage of parking spaces and the problem of irregular parking in cities.',\n",
       "  'The system has therefore been listed among the countrys innovation projects that integrate AI deeply into the real economy in by Chinas Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT).Traditional parking management equipment and monitoring devices have failed to meet the actual needs of cities due to limited application scenarios and technical capacity.',\n",
       "  'There are many deficiencies in traditional parking systems.',\n",
       "  'For example, magnetic devices cannot identify detailed information about vehicles; each video monitoring pile can only cover one parking spot; and manual collection of parking fees costs too much.',\n",
       "  'Such problems dont exist in smart machines.',\n",
       "  'The AIpark Sky Eye system boasts strong stability and high recognition rate.',\n",
       "  'Besides, it can resist the interference of extreme weather conditions like rain, snow, and fog, and form complete graphic evidence based on wheel path of vehicles.',\n",
       "  'Each set of cameras of the AIpark Sky Eye system can monitor multiple parking spots at the same time for hours a day.',\n",
       "  'The data collected by front-end cameras are processed using multi-dimensional deep learning algorithm before they are uploaded on to an AI computing cloud platform for data enrichment.',\n",
       "  'The platform then distributes identification results to transport authorities.',\n",
       "  'The most distinctive innovation in the technological package of the system is precision brought about by high-mounted parking system cameras, according to Xiang Yanping, senior vice president of AIpark, noting that the cameras can recognize more complex static and dynamic reality scenes.',\n",
       "  'For example, the equipment can accurately identify irregular parking behaviors and state such as double parking and frequent maneuvers, precisely recognize detailed information including plate number and vehicle color, and make good judgment on the behaviors of drivers and pedestrians, Xiang said.',\n",
       "  'Once the high-mounted parking system cameras are installed, they can help with many aspects of integrated urban governance, which represents another advantage of the AIpark Sky Eye system.',\n",
       "  'Besides managing parking fee collection, high-mounted camera system can also provide data for traffic improvements.',\n",
       "  'The snapshots obtained from the camera system can help solve problems including illegal and inappropriate parking and vehicle theft.',\n",
       "  \"So far, the smart ETC system of AIpark has been introduced into more than cities in China, signaling increasingly important roles of AI in improving parking efficiency and order as well as new development opportunities for smart parking industry.123PhotosNaval fleet steams in East China SeaNewborn golden snub-nosed monkey makes debutIn pics: birds across ChinaGrain painting studio helps villagers to increase incomeRelated StoriesExhibition highlighting art-science integration opens in BeijingChinas AI industry poised to enter boom timesAlibaba outlines technology trends for Chinas leading AI enterprise iFlytek to develop health information technologyCheetah Mobile wades into artificial intelligenceChina overtakes the US in investment in AI5 million artificial intelligence talents urgently needed in ChinaGraduate students give 'voice' to sign languageArtificial Intelligence in real livesMicrosoft embraces artificial intelligenceAbout People's Daily Online | Join Us | Contact UsCopyright People's Daily Online.\",\n",

       "  'Each of the one billion images analyzed includes AI enhancing data from over different browser and version combinations, viewport information, and direct user feedback on defects, dynamic content, and more.',\n",
       "  'This uniquely enables Applitools to maintain % accuracy to hundreds of Enterprise customers worldwide including the top software companies worldwide, five out of the top banks in the US, and many other Global companies.',\n",
