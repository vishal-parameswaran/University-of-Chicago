    "\n",
    "#### Sentiment\n",
    "Determine whether your content conveys postive or negative sentiment. Sentiment information can be returned for detected entities, keywords, or user-specified target phrases found in the text.\n",

    "#### Emotion\n",
    "Detect anger, disgust, fear, joy, or sadness that is conveyed by your content. Emotion information can be returned for detected entities, keywords, or user-specified target phrases found in the text.\n",

    "#### Relations\n",
